        <h1>Programming Job Trends in 2025</h1>
        <p>In 2025, the programming job market continues to expand, with certain technologies and skills becoming more valuable than ever. Companies are seeking professionals who can adapt quickly to new tools, frameworks, and work environments.</p>

        <h2>1. Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning</h2>
        <p>AI and ML remain at the top of the demand list. Developers with experience in AI-powered applications, data science, and predictive analytics are in high demand, especially in finance, healthcare, and automation industries.</p>

        <h2>2. Cloud-Native Development</h2>
        <p>With most companies migrating to cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, skills in cloud-native application development, serverless computing, and containerization (Docker, Kubernetes) are essential for staying competitive.</p>

        <h2>3. Cybersecurity Expertise</h2>
        <p>As cyber threats grow more complex, programmers with cybersecurity knowledge are highly valued. Secure coding practices, penetration testing, and compliance knowledge are key areas to master.</p>

        <h2>4. Remote Work Skills</h2>
        <p>Distributed teams are now the normal, making collaboration tools, version control (Git), and agile methodologies critical for success.</p>

        <h2>5. Hot Programming Languages</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Python – AI, Data Science, Automation</li>
            <li>JavaScript/TypeScript – Web & Mobile Development</li>
            <li>Rust – High-performance and secure systems</li>
            <li>Go – Cloud-native applications</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In short, adaptability and continuous learning will be the defining factors for success in the programming field in 2025 and beyond.</p>
